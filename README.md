Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning
Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using machine learning techniques. Leveraging various patient health indicators, we build and evaluate models to identify individuals at risk of diabetes, providing valuable insights for early diagnosis and preventive healthcare.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, normalize data, and select relevant features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights from the data using statistical analysis and visualization.

Model Building: Implement various machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC curve.
